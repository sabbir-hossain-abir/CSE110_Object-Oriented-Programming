# Practice Problem Set 2

1. Write a program that asks the user to enter an integer and checks whether it is divisible by 3 or 5.

Examples Input &  Output
Input
15 3

Output 
Divisible by 5 Not divisible by 3 or 5

2. Following is the income tax percentage a person has to give according to his salary range:
Salary Range Tax percentage of income
Below 30,000 4%
30,000-70,000 10%
Above 70,000 15%

Write a program that asks the user to input his salary and prints the amount of income tax he has to give.
Examples
Input
45000
Output
4500
Hints:
Income Tax = Salary * Tax percentage of income

3. When stocks are sold or purchased through a broker, the broker’s commission is often computed using a sliding
scale that depends upon the value of stocks traded. Let’s say that a broker charges the amounts shown in the
following table:

Transaction Size Commission rate
Under $2,500 $30 + 1.7%
$2,500 - $6,250 $56 + 0.66%
$6,250 - $20,000 $76 + 0.34%
$20,000 - $50,000 $100 + 0.22%
$50,000 - $500,000 $155 + 0.11%
Over $500,000 $255 + 0.09%

The minimum charge is $39.
Write a program that asks the user to enter the amount of trade, then displays the amount of commission.
Examples
Input Input
30,000 125
Output Output
$166.00 $39.00
